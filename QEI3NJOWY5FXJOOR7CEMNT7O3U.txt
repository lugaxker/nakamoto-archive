Ah, I see, thanks for the corrections.

Some of the discussion and concern over performance may relate to the eventual size of the P2P node network. How large do you envision it becoming? Tens of nodes? Thousands?  Millions?

And for clients, do you think this could scale to be usable for close
to 100% of world financial transactions? Or would you see it as mostly
being used for some "core" subset of transactions that have special
requirements, with other transactions using a different payment system
that perhaps is based on Bitcoin?
