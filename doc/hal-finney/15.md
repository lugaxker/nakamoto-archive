Hi Satoshi - debug.log attached. When I started 0.1.2 this afternoon, I first quit the previous version which was running. However, 0.1.2 would not start up. Looking at the debug log, it said "Existing instance found". I ran task manager, and found two processes called bitcoin.exe running. I killed them both and started up the new one, and it seemed to run OK. It says at the bottom "3 connections". I haven't tried the debug version, I'm not sure what I would look for.
