Thanks, Satoshi, this new version seems to be running much better. I've got 8 connections, and watching debug.log there seems to be quite a bit of activity. I see you sent me a payment, thanks! Let me know your address and I will try sending one to you. I managed to generate a block yesterday and the coins are about to mature, if I understand it correctly.
