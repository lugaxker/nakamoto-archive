Ah, I see, thanks for the corrections.

Some of the discussion and concern over performance may relate to the eventual size of the P2P node network. How large do you envision it becoming? Tens of nodes? Thousands? &nbsp;Millions?

And for clients, do you think this could scale to be usable for close to 100% of world financial transactions? Or would you see it as mostly being used for some "core" subset of transactions that have special requirements, with other transactions using a different payment system that perhaps is based on Bitcoin?
