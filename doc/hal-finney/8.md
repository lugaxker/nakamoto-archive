Yes, actually the version with MSVC symbols would be better, that is the one I am using.

I found that if I launched this one from a cygwin shell, it does not crash. But if I launch it from Windows, double-clicking on the file, it does crash similarly to the previous version. However, I am pretty sure that the previous version did crash even when I launched it from cygwin.

I have to go out but I'll leave this version running for a while.
