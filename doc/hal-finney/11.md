Hi Satoshi - The version with the .pdb file did not run for me, I got an error about MSVCP60D.DLL not being found. I imagine this is due to the version incompatibility you were worried about.

The next version, that deleted the questionable line of code and turned off optimization, seems to run fine for me. So the problem may be related to that bit.
