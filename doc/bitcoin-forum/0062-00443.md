# Re: Bitcoin Address Collisions

Post by: satoshi on February 23, 2010, 04:26:09 PM

There's a separate public/private keypair for every bitcoin address. &nbsp;You don't have a single private key that unlocks everything. &nbsp;Bitcoin addresses are a 160-bit hash of the public key, everything else in the system is 256-bit.

If there was a collision, the collider could spend any money sent to that address. &nbsp;Just money sent to that address, not the whole wallet.

If you were to intentionally try to make a collision, it would currently take 2^126 times longer to generate a colliding bitcoin address than to generate a block. &nbsp;You could have got a lot more money by generating blocks.

The random seed is very thorough. &nbsp;On Windows, it uses all the performance monitor data that measures every bit of disk performance, network card metrics, cpu time, paging etc. since your computer started. &nbsp;Linux has a built-in entropy collector. &nbsp;Adding to that, every time you move your mouse inside the Bitcoin window you're generating entropy, and entropy is captured from the timing of disk ops.
