If you're only going to have one person work on building the block, that could take days. &nbsp;Oh, do you mean send a different variation to each node with the tx fee written to them?

The way it is now, it's whoever builds this gets it.

If we needed to, we could have a BitTorrent-esque tit-for-tat for transaction broadcast. &nbsp;Relay paying transactions to me, or I won't relay them to you. &nbsp;It probably won't be an actual problem though. &nbsp;It only takes one node relaying like it should to cancel out 7 others greedily not relaying.
