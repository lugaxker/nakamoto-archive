That big of a difference in speed, by a factor of 4 or 6, feels like it's likely to be some quirky weak spot or instruction that the old chip is slow with. &nbsp;Unless it's a touted feature of the i5 that they made SSE2 six times faster.

A quick summary:<br>
Xeon Quad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 41% slower<br>
Core 2 Duo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55% slower<br>
Core 2 Duo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same (vess)<br>
Core 2 Quad &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50% slower<br>
Core i5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200% faster (nelisky)<br>
Core i5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100% faster (vess)<br>
AMD Opteron &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105% faster

aceat64:<br>
My system went from ~7100 to ~4200.<br>
This particular system has dual Intel Xeon Quad-Core CPUs (E5335) @ 2.00GHz.

impossible7:<br>
on an Intel Core 2 Duo T7300 running x86_64 linux it was 55% slower compared to the stock version (r121)

nelisky:<br>
My Core2Quad (Q6600) slowed down 50%,<br>
my i5 improved ~200%,

impossible7:<br>
on an AMD Opteron 2374 HE running x86_64 linux I got a 105% improvement (!)
