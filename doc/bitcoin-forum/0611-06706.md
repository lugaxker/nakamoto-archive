# Re: [PATCH] implement 'listtransactions'

What are you needing to use listtransactions for?

The reason I didn't implement listtransactions is I want to make sure web programmers don't use it. &nbsp;It would be very easy to latch onto that for watching for received payments. &nbsp;There is no reliable way to do it that way and make sure nothing can slip through the cracks. &nbsp;Until we have solid example code using getreceivedbyaddress and getreceivedbylabel to point to and say "use this! use this! don't use listtransactions!", I don't think we should implement listtransactions.

When we do implement listtransactions, maybe one way to fight that is to make it all text. &nbsp;It should not break down the fields into e.g. comment, confirmations, credit, debit. &nbsp;It could be one pretty formatted string like "0/unconfirmed &nbsp;&nbsp;0:0:0 date &nbsp;&nbsp;comment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debit 4 &nbsp;credit 0" or something so it's hard for programmers to do the wrong thing and process it. &nbsp;It's only for viewing the status of your server. &nbsp;I guess that would be kinda annoying for web interfaces that would rather format it into html columns though.
