wx/clipbrd.h isn't used, move it inside the #if wxUSE_GUI.

Updated headers.h on SVN.

Sorry, I linked to wxbase but I had full wxWidgets on my computer.

The db.h:140 class Db no member named "exisits" is stranger. &nbsp;pdb->get, pdb->put, pdb->del compiled before that. &nbsp;Do you have version 4.7.25 of Berkeley DB?

Db::exists()<br>

I suppose they might have added exists recently, using get before that.
