Forgot to say, I suspected the detect might not work on 64-bit AMD. &nbsp;I found it hard to believe but AMD reports a different model number in 64-bit mode.

Could you grep CPUID your debug.log and tell me what it says? &nbsp;(and anyone else with 64-bit AMD) &nbsp;And what AMD chip do you have?

Do all AMDs that support 64-bit have the better SSE2 hardware also?
