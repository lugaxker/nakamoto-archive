# Re: Share database blocks ?

It does in fact download 500 blocks at a time, then the counter counts one at a time as it verifies the blocks.

The advantage of letting bitcoin download and verify the blocks is that you do not have to trust the person you're downloading them from. &nbsp;If you downloaded the blk\*.dat files from some site, you would have to trust that site, since you would be accepting the data without verifying it yourself. &nbsp;If you're copying blk\*.dat from another computer of yours, that should be fine.

How long is the initial block download taking for you?
