# Re: Dealing with SHA-256 Collisions

Post by: satoshi on June 14, 2010, 08:39:50 PM

SHA-256 is very strong. &nbsp;It's not like the incremental step from MD5 to SHA1. &nbsp;It can last several decades unless there's some massive breakthrough attack.

If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.

If the hash breakdown came gradually, we could transition to a new hash in an orderly way. &nbsp;The software would be programmed to start using a new hash after a certain block number. &nbsp;Everyone would have to upgrade by that time. &nbsp;The software could save the new hash of all the old blocks to make sure a different block with the same old hash can't be used.
