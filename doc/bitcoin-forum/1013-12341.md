# Re: Won't let me send coins because it requires a transaction fee?

What version is the one where this happened? &nbsp;Release build, or built it yourself? &nbsp;Which operating system?

Were you sending by IP or by Bitcoin Address?

When you sent 49.99, did it prompt you to pay a 0.01 fee?

There was a change in GetMinFee, but I can't see how it would cause this. &nbsp;It only starts to apply when a block gets huge.

The reason for the difference in block number is the number displayed was reduced by 1 in 0.3.11 because it made more sense that way.
