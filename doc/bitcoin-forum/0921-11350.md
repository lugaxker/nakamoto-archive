I doubt there's an mmap(2) on Windows. &nbsp;I'd rather call an existing file copy function than make and test my own.

Thanks. &nbsp;I thought it would be in there somewhere.

We already use boost::filesystem in a dozen places. &nbsp;It's not a new added dependency. &nbsp;It gives us a lot of portable stuff that we would otherwise have to have a #ifdef for each OS and test everywhere.
