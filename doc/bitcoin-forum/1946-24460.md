Version 0.3.17 is now available.

Changes:<br>
\- new getwork, thanks m0mchil<br>
\- added transaction fee setting in UI options menu<br>
\- free transaction limits<br>
\- sendtoaddress returns transaction id instead of "sent"<br>
\- getaccountaddress <account\>

The UI transaction fee setting was easy since it was still there from 0.1.5 and all I had to do was re-enable it.

The accounts-based commands: move, sendfrom and getbalance <account\> will be in the next release. &nbsp;We still have some more changes to make first.
