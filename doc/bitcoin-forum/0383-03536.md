Good point. &nbsp;If you're going to have more than 8 LAN nodes connect to one gateway node, then you'd better have the gateway node set up so it can receive incoming connections. &nbsp;Otherwise, while the gateway node has 8 or more connections, it will not try to add any more outbound connections. &nbsp;As the outside nodes you're connected to come and go, it doesn't make new outbound connections to replace them. &nbsp;You'll be fine if you can accept incoming connections, then there will be plenty of others connecting to you.
