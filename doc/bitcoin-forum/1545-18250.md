# Re: Suggestion: Allow short messages to be sent together with bitcoins ?

ECDSA can't encrypt messages, only sign signatures.

It would be unwise to have permanently recorded plaintext messages for everyone to see. &nbsp;It would be an accident waiting to happen.

If there's going to be a message system, it should be a separate system parallel to the bitcoin network. &nbsp;Messages should not be recorded in the block chain. &nbsp;The messages could be signed with the bitcoin address keypairs to prove who they're from.
