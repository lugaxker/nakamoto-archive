ShadowOfHarbringer, is yours faster with -4way?

If it is, then I'm thinking that any AMD that supports 64-bit has 128-bit SSE2.

The specialbuild version I posted here looks for model 4 or higher. &nbsp;If yours is faster with -4way, then I should change it to always use SSE2 with any AMD with 64-bit.
