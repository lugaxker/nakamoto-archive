No, don't "bring it on".

The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way.

I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. &nbsp;Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. &nbsp;You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.
