Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments. &nbsp;Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01. &nbsp;The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.

Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods. &nbsp;Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range. &nbsp;But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments.
