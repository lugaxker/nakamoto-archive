Here's RC1 for linux for testing:<br>
(link removed, see below)

It contains both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.

Recent changes:

build-unix.txt:<br>
\- Added instructions for building wxBase, which is needed to compile bitcoind.<br>
\- The package libboost-dev doesn't install anything anymore, you need to get libboost-all-dev.<br>
\- Updated version numbers.

makefile.unix:<br>
\- The libboost libraries have removed the "-mt" from their filenames in 1.40. &nbsp;If you're compiling with Boost 1.38 or lower, like on Ubuntu Karmic, you would need to change it back to boost_system-mt and boost_filesystem-mt.
