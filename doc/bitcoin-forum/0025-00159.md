Yes, it's a technical limitation. &nbsp;Sending by bitcoin address enters the transaction into the network and the recipient discovers it from the network. &nbsp;You don't connect directly with them and they don't have to be online at the time.

I very much wanted to find some way to include a short message, but the problem is, the whole world would be able to see the message. &nbsp;As much as you may keep reminding people that the message is completely non-private, it would be an accident waiting to happen.

Unfortunately, ECDSA can only sign signatures, it can't encrypt messages, and we need the small size of ECDSA. &nbsp;RSA can encrypt messages, but it's many times bigger than ECDSA.
