# Re: overflow bug SERIOUS

Don't update the block chain download. &nbsp;When you take someone's block chain download, you don't want it right up to the end. &nbsp;A somewhat old one is better so it can download and verify the most recent blocks.

tcatm's 4-way SSE2 SHA-256 is in the file sha256.cpp and already uploaded a few revs ago.

I just now uploaded rev 134 which is the makefile.unix that enables building with it on Linux. &nbsp;If you build rev 134 on Linux now you'll get the -4way switch.

If you have problems building because of it, then edit makefile.unix and:<br>
\- remove -DFOURWAYSSE2<br>
\- remove obj/sha256.o from the end of these lines:<br>
bitcoin: $(OBJS) obj/ui.o obj/uibase.o obj/sha256.o<br>
bitcoind: $(OBJS:obj/%=obj/nogui/%) obj/sha256.o

The 0.3.10 linux build will have the -4way option when I build it.

Here are the patch downloads for Windows:

http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.10-win32-setup.exe <br>
http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.10-win32.zip

SHA1 16645ec5fcdb35bc54bc7195309a1a81105242bb bitcoin-0.3.10-win32-setup.exe<br>
SHA1 4f35ad7711a38fe8c880c6c9beab430824c426d3 bitcoin-0.3.10-win32.zip

Steps:<br>
1) Shut down.<br>
2) Download knightmb's blk files and replace your blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat files.<br>
http://knightmb.dyndns.org/files/bitcoin/blocks/ <br>
http://rapidshare.com/files/413168038/BitcoinBlocks.torrent <br>
3) Upgrade to 0.3.10.<br>
4) It should start out with less than 74000 blocks and redownload the rest.

Or if you don't want to mess with downloading blk files, you can just do this:

1) Shut down.<br>
2) Delete (or move) blk\*.dat<br>
3) Upgrade to 0.3.10.<br>
4) It redownloads all blocks, probably take about an hour.
