So that was responsible for keeping blocks from downloading?

The link: "Win32 CPU Cycles vs 'Live Protection' Engines"

For BitcoinFX, Live Protection was keeping it from getting CPU for generating coins. &nbsp;You said your friend was getting 1400-1600 khash/s, so it was getting CPU. &nbsp;I guess Live Protection must have been blocking some other part of the program then?
