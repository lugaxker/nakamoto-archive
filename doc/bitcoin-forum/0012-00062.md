There would be a command line switch at runtime to tell it to run without UI. &nbsp;All it needs to do is not create the main window. &nbsp;A simplistic way would be to disable "pframeMain->Show" and "ptaskbaricon->Show" in ui.cpp. &nbsp;The network threads don't care that the UI isn't there. &nbsp;The only other UI is a message box in CheckDiskSpace if it runs out of disk space.

Then a separate command line utility to communicate with it to do things. &nbsp;Not sure what it should be named.

"natural deflation"... I like that name for it. &nbsp;Yes, there will be natural deflation due to payment mistakes and lost data. &nbsp;Coin creation will eventually get slow enough that it is exceeded by natural deflation and we'll have net deflation.
