I'll start thinking about how to do this.

At the moment, you can kind of use -connect. &nbsp;You can use -connect to make it connect to local computers on your LAN, like -connect=192.168.0.100. &nbsp;If you start it out blank and don't let it connect to the main network, the difficulty is still at the original low difficulty. &nbsp;If you've port-forwarded though, then outside nodes might still connect inward to you.

With -connect it still uses IRC, do you think it shouldn't get on IRC when you're telling it to only connect to specific nodes with -connect? &nbsp;The main scenario for -connect is where you have a server farm, with two connected to the network and the rest connected to the first two. &nbsp;In that case, you wouldn't want the -connect computers on IRC.

void ThreadIRCSeed(void* parg)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (mapArgs.count("-connect"))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;
