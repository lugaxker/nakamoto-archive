My fear is too many programmers would latch onto that for checking for received payments. &nbsp;It can never be reliable that way. &nbsp;The list/getreceivedbyaddress/label functions are the only way to do it reliably.

We shouldn't delay forever until every possible feature is done. &nbsp;There's always going to be one more thing to do.
