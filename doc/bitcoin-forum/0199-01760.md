I don't know. &nbsp;Maybe someone with more Linux experience knows how to install the library it needs.

I built it on Ubuntu 10.04. &nbsp;I hope that wasn't a mistake. &nbsp;Maybe it should have been built on an older version for more backward compatibility. &nbsp;Is this a problem on Linux, that if you build on the latest version, then it has trouble working on older versions? &nbsp;Is there any way I can downgrade to an older version of GCC on 10.04?

The 64-bit version shouldn't be any faster than the 32-bit version, but it would be great if someone could do a side-by-side comparison of the two linux versions and check. &nbsp;SHA-256 is a 32-bit algorithm and nothing in BitcoinMiner uses 64-bit at all.

We don't need to bother with a 64-bit version for Windows. &nbsp;32-bit programs work on all versions of Windows. &nbsp;It's not like Linux where the 64-bit OS wants 64-bit programs.

I'm also curious if it's a little faster on linux than windows.

Do you think I should make the directories:<br>
/bin32/<br>
/bin64/<br>
instead of<br>
/bin/32/<br>
/bin/64/
