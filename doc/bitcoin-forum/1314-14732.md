It ramps up the fee requirement as the block fills up:

<50KB &nbsp;free<br>
50KB &nbsp;&nbsp;0.01<br>
250KB &nbsp;0.02<br>
333KB &nbsp;0.03<br>
375KB &nbsp;0.04<br>
etc.

It's a typical pricing mechanism. &nbsp;After the first 50KB sells out, the price is raised to 0.01. &nbsp;After 250KB is sold, it goes up to 0.02. &nbsp;At some price, you can pretty much always get in if you're willing to outbid the other customers.

Just including the minimum 0.01 goes a long way.
