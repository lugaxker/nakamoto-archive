Version 0.3.12 is now available.

Features:<br>
- json-rpc errors return a more standard error object. (thanks to Gavin Andresen)<br>
- json-rpc command line returns exit codes.<br>
- json-rpc "backupwallet" command.<br>
- Recovers and continues if an exception is caused by a message you received. &nbsp;Other nodes shouldn't be able to cause an exception, and it hasn't happened before, but if a way is found to cause an exception, this would keep it from being used to stop network nodes.

If you have json-rpc code that checks the contents of the error string, you need to change it to expect error objects of the form {"code":<number>,"message":<string>}, which is the standard. &nbsp;See this thread:<br>
