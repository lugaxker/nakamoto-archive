# Re: Big endian code problems

The code assumes little-endian throughout and was written with the intention of never being ported to big-endian. &nbsp;Every integer that is sent over the network would have to be byte swapped, in addition to many dozens of other places in code. &nbsp;It would not be worth the extra sourcecode bloat.

Big-endian is on its way out anyway.
