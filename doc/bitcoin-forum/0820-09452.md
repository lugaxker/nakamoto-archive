0.3.10 has tcatm's 4-way SSE2 as an option switch.

Use the switch "-4way" to turn it on. &nbsp;Without the switch you get Crypto++ ASM SHA-256.

I could only get this working with Linux.

Get 0.3.10 from http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=827.0

Please report back your CPU and results! &nbsp;I think it's pretty clear that Core 2 and lower are slower, i5 faster. &nbsp;I don't think we've heard any i7 results yet. &nbsp;We need to know about the different models of AMD or other less common CPUs.
