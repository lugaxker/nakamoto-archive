# Re: IPv6, headless client, and more

Welcome, Harry.

I hadn't thought about starting out using bitcoind without using bitcoin first. &nbsp;I guess for now, this thread serves as the tutorial.

The focus for bitcoind so far has been more on backend support for websites. &nbsp;There's demand for things that would be nice for adminning headless generators like listgenerated. &nbsp;For the moment, you can grep the debug.log file for "generated" and "hashmeter" for some feedback. &nbsp;Generated blocks take about 24 hours before they're credited to your balance.
