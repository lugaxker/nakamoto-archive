# Re: How To Make a Distributed BitCoin Escrow Service

It's not implemented yet, but the network can support a transaction that requires two signatures. &nbsp;It's described here:<br>

It's absolutely safer than a straight payment without escrow, but not as good as a human arbitrated escrow, assuming you trust the human enough.

In this kind of escrow, a cheater can't win, but it's still possible for you to lose. &nbsp;It at least takes away the profit motive for cheating you. &nbsp;The seller is assured that the money is reserved for him, while the buyer retains the leverage that the seller hasn't been paid yet until completion.
