# Need a post writing up some things users should know

Post by: satoshi on August 19, 2010, 08:14:01 PM

I'm not sure what to call it, but we could use a post that lists these things users should know. &nbsp;If someone has time to write it, here's the list:

\- Make sure your clock is set correctly.

\- Microsoft Security Essentials. &nbsp;This never got written up proper.

\- Warning not to mess around with your wallet.dat file. &nbsp;It's a database file, it's not as simple as you think. &nbsp;In this Beta version, we haven't had time to try and tinker-proof it yet. &nbsp;It may not work as expected if you start swapping it around.
