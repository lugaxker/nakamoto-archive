Repeating myself here, but there is open source software for that, so it would just be a matter of bolting on a Bitcoin payment mechanism. &nbsp;One good one I found was Mihalism Multi Host. &nbsp;It's designed as a free host, so it would just need a few tweaks to loosen up restrictions consistent with paid use.
