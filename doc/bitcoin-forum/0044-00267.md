# Re: How divisible are bitcoins and other market/economic questions

Eventually at most only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the world if it really gets huge.

But don't worry, there are another 6 decimal places that aren't shown, for a total of 8 decimal places internally. &nbsp;It shows 1.00 but internally it's 1.00000000. &nbsp;If there's massive deflation in the future, the software could show more decimal places.

If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point. &nbsp;Same amount of money, just different convention for where the ","'s and "."'s go. &nbsp;e.g. moving the decimal place 3 places would mean if you had 1.00000 before, now it shows it as 1,000.00.
