OK, back to 0.3 then.

Please download RC4 and check it over as soon as possible. &nbsp;I'd like to release it soon.

Other than the version number change, which included changes in readme.txt and setup.nsi, I reduced the maximum number of outbound connections from 15 to 8 so nodes that accept inbound don't get too many connections. &nbsp;15 was a lot more than needed. &nbsp;8 is still plenty for redundancy.
