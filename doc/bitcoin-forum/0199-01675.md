What operating system?

Normally when it does that it's because the directory where the data directory should go doesn't exist. &nbsp;See if the "%appdata%" directory exists.

Do you get that error with 0.2 also? &nbsp;It's hard to see how you could get that with 0.3 and not with 0.2 since there's nothing different in that regard.
