> I added to the FAQ the warning to back up after each transaction. Is it necessary btw to stop the client before making a backup? That's a bit inconvenient. Automatic backups would be useful indeed.

You can get away with backing up without stopping the client if you don't do anything or receive a payment within a few seconds before the backup. &nbsp;(like 5 seconds)

> Wait, I'm confused again. I thought the essence of the surprise was that Bitcoin is programmed to "empty your wallet" for EACH transaction.

No, it doesn't usually empty your wallet with each transaction. &nbsp;It uses the smallest set of coins it can find to add up to near the amount. &nbsp;In this case, unfortunately, his wallet had a single 9000 BTC bill in it, and it had to break it to get 1 BTC and 8999 BTC change.
