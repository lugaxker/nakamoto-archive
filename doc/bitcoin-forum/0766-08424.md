# Connection limits

Post by: satoshi on August 09, 2010, 08:58:45 PM

SVN rev 125:<br>
\- Always make 8 outbound connections even if have 8 inbound<br>
\- Limit outbound connections to one per a.b.?.? range<br>
\- Switch -maxconnections=\#

I added the (currently undocumented) switch -maxconnections=\#. &nbsp;You shouldn't use it unless you need to because your router can't maintain a lot of connections, then try -maxconnections=30.

I haven't really tested -maxconnections much, could someone test it?
