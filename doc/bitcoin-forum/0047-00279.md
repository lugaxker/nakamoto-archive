Thank you for the offer to help translate. &nbsp;That is probably the best way you could help.

I will need to prepare the code for translation first. &nbsp;wxWidgets has locale support, and most strings are in generated code that is already wrapped, so it shouldn't be too hard. &nbsp;We also must finish upgrading to wxWidgets-2.9.0 to get UTF-8 support. &nbsp;I've done test builds with 2.9.0 and there is one bug left to fix.

What operating system are you using? &nbsp;Windows, Linux 32-bit or 64 bit?
