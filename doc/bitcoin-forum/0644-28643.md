Thanks for setting this up Cdecker.

Is there any chance of getting it to build the GUI version also? &nbsp;If this is Ubuntu, if you get wxWidgets 2.9.0 it should just be a matter of following the steps in build-unix.txt exactly. &nbsp;Is this an environment where you can build wxWidgets once and leave it there and just keep using it?
