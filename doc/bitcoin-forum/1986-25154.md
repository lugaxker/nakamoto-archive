Very much not. &nbsp;Using multiple copies of wallet.dat is not recommended or supported, in fact all of Bitcoin is designed to defeat that. &nbsp;Both copies will get screwed up.

If you're trying to consolidate your generated coins into one wallet, a better solution now is to run getwork miners on the additional systems. &nbsp;jgarzik has a CPU miner, and it supports tcatm's 4-way SSE2, so on Windows it's up to twice as fast as the built-in SHA if you have an AMD or recent Intel (core 3, 5 or 7).

New demonstration CPU miner available:<br>
