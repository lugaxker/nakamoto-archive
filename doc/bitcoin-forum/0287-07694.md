One alternative is to use a round-up system. &nbsp;You pay for, say, 1000 pages or images or downloads or searches or whatever at a time. &nbsp;When you've used up your 1000 pages, you pay for another 1000 pages. &nbsp;If you only use 1 page, then you have 999 left that you may never use, but it's not a big deal because the cost per 1000 is still small.

Or you could pay per day. &nbsp;The first time you access the site on a given day, you pay for 24 hours of access.

Per 1000 or per day may be easier for consumers to get their heads around too. &nbsp;They worry about per item because it's harder to figure if it might add up too fast. &nbsp;Unlimited for 24 hours they know what the cost will be. &nbsp;Or if 1000 seems like plenty, they're not worrying that it's costing more with each click if they figure 1000 is more than they'll probably use.
