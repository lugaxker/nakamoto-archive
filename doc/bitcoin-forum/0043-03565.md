# Re: Proof-of-work difficulty increasing

Right, the difficulty adjustment is trying to keep it so the network as a whole generates an average of 6 blocks per hour. &nbsp;The time for your block to mature will always be around 20 hours.

The recent adjustment put us back to close to 6 blocks per hour again.

There's a site where you can see the time between blocks, and since block 68545, it's been more like 10 minutes per block:<br />
