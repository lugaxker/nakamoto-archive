There are now "Sending" and "Receiving" tabs in the Address Book. &nbsp;Your addresses are referred to as "receiving addresses".

madhatter was working on building it on Mac. &nbsp;He had errors probably caused by UTF-16 wxWidgets 2.8. &nbsp;Should have better luck now with 2.9.0. &nbsp;wxWidgets 2.9.0 is UTF-8 and wouldn't have that problem.

I think he had it working on FreeBSD, but he wanted a non-UI version.

I have the command line and JSON-RPC daemon version working now. &nbsp;Will SVN it in a day or two.

I disabled gdm on my Ubuntu system so it boots into command line. &nbsp;I hope I will be able to get it enabled again with rcconf.
