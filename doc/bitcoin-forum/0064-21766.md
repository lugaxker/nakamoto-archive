# Re: New icon/logo

I'm happy if someone with artistic skill wants to contribute alternatives. &nbsp;The icon/logo was meant to be good as an icon at the 16x16 and 20x20 pixel sizes. &nbsp;I think it's the best program icon, but there's room for improvement at larger sizes for a graphic for use on websites.

It'll be a lot simpler if authors could make their graphics public domain.
