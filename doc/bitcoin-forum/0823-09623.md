Right, it will get reincorporated into the fixed chain.&nbsp;The transaction won't disappear, it'll still be visible on both sides, but the confirmation count will jump back to 0 and start counting up again.

It's only if you generated a block in the bad chain after block 74638 that the 50 BTC from that will disappear.&nbsp;Any blocks in the bad chain wouldn't have matured yet.
