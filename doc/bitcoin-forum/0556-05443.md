Please test 0.3.2.5 in preparation for the 0.3.3 release! &nbsp;This build is looking good and should be the one that goes into 0.3.3. &nbsp;I encourage you to go ahead and upgrade now if you're on Windows or Linux.

New features:<br>
\- Gavin Andresen's HTTP authentication to secure JSON-RPC<br>
\- 5x faster initial block download, under 30 minutes
