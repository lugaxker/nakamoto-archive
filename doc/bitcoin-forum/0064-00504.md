New icons, what do you think? &nbsp;Better than the old one?

Full size 530x529 image for scaling down to custom sizes:<br>

The perspective shadow was too thick on the larger sizes. &nbsp;I updated 32, 48 and the full size.

I release these images into the public domain (copyright-free). &nbsp;I request that derivative works be made public domain.
