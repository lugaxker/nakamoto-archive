# Re: Bitcoin clients getting k-lined from the IRC bootstrapping channel

We need more details about what happened MadHatter.

Both 0.2 and 0.3 have a backup way of getting connected without IRC, it's just slower to get connected.

0.2 can find other nodes without IRC if it's ever been connected before, but a new install can't discover the network for the first time without IRC.

0.3 can also seed without IRC. &nbsp;It can operate entirely without IRC if it needs to, but it's better having IRC for redundancy.
