# Re: A proposal for a semi-automated Escrow mechanism

A transaction can be written that requires two signatures to spend it next. &nbsp;You write a payment that requires the signature of both the recipient and the sender to spend it. &nbsp;To release the escrow, you give the recipient the signature for your half, or the payee can return it by giving you his signed half. &nbsp;There's no mediator in this simple case. &nbsp;The recourse is to refuse to ever release it, essentially burning the money.
