It doesn't have to be such a breaking change. &nbsp;New nodes could accept old transactions for a long time until most nodes have already upgraded before starting to refuse transactions without PoW. &nbsp;Or, they could always accept old transactions, but only a limited number per time period.

I've thought about PoW on transactions many times, but usually I end up thinking a 0.01 transaction fee is essentially similar and better. &nbsp;0.01 is basically a proof of work, but not wasted. &nbsp;But if the problem is validating loads of transactions, then PoW could be checked faster.

A more general umbrella partial solution would be to implement the idea where an unlikely dropoff in blocks received is detected. &nbsp;Then an attacker would still need a substantial portion of the network's power to benefit from a DoS attack.

+1

Any demonstration tests at this point would only show what we already know, and divert dev time from strengthening the system to operational fire fighting.
