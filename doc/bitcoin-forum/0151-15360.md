poedit does it. &nbsp;Either get the src directory from a release, or download it with SVN. &nbsp;Place your .po file 3 directories deep under the src directory. &nbsp;Open it with poedit and do Catalog->Update from sources.

So for example, you have:<br>
src<br>
src\base58.h<br>
src\bignum.h<br>
...<br>
src\util.cpp<br>
src\util.h<br>
src\xpm<br>
src\locale\ru\LC_MESSAGES\bitcoin.po

Open bitcoin.po with poedit, do Catalog->Update from sources. &nbsp;It looks for the sourcecode up 3 directories (..\\..\\..) from where bitcoin.po is.

This updates your existing .po file you already worked on and adds any news strings. &nbsp;It may try to match close strings, so check things over and make sure it didn't make any bad guesses.

Make sure you use the .po file I uploaded to SVN or in a release, because I always fix up at least a few things. &nbsp;I'm attaching your Russian one to this message.
