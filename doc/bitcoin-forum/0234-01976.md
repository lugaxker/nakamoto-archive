BTW, I did come to my senses after that brief bout with 1.3, this release is still going to be 0.3 beta not 1.0.

I really appreciate the effort, but there are a lot of problems.

We don't want to lead with "anonymous". &nbsp;(I've been meaning to edit the homepage)

"The developers expect that this will result in a stable-with-respect-to-energy currency outside the reach of any government." \-\- I am definitely not making an such taunt or assertion.

It's not stable-with-respect-to-energy. &nbsp;There was a discussion on this. &nbsp;It's not tied to the cost of energy. &nbsp;NLS's estimate based on energy was a good estimated starting point, but market forces will increasingly dominate.

Sorry to be a wet blanket. &nbsp;Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. &nbsp;There's nothing to relate it to.
