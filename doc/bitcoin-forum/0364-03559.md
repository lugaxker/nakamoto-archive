I've been trying to encourage someone to write and release some sample Python code showing the recommended way to do the typical accounting stuff, but to no avail. &nbsp;It would be nice if you didn't have to re-invent the wheel like you're doing here. &nbsp;Search on getnewaddress and you should find a thread where I gave a small fragment of sample pseudocode.
