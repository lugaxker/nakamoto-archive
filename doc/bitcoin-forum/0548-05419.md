# Re: bitcoind not responding to RPC

Can anyone confirm if JSON-RPC over HTTP is supposed to use status 500 if the reply is an error reply? &nbsp;I can't remember where I picked that up, maybe it's wrong. &nbsp;It seems like 200 would make more sense unless there's something wrong with the mechanics of the HTTP request itself. &nbsp;(and maybe that's what it said and I forgot and spread 500 to all error responses)
