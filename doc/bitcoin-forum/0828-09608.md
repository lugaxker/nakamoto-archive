# Re: 0.3.10.1 Question on where block should be

Post by: satoshi on August 16, 2010, 12:28:28 AM

I suspect there's some difficulty receiving blocks if all the nodes you're connected to are 0.3.9 or lower. &nbsp;We need enough of us so that at least one node you connect to will be 0.3.10. &nbsp;The problem will start to go away when we make up more than 1/8th of the network.

It'll help if you port forward so you can get lots of connections.
