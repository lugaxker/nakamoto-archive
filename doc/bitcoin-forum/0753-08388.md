I found that SSE2 only added a slight 2% speedup, which didn't seem worth the incompatibility. &nbsp;I was trying to take the safer option.

It doesn't look to me like Crypto++ could be deciding whether to use SSE2 at runtime. &nbsp;There's one place where it detects SSE2 for deciding some block count parameter, but the SSE2 stuff is all #ifdef at compile time and I can't see how that would switch at runtime. &nbsp;Maybe I'm not looking in the right place.

Should we enable SSE2 in all the makefiles? &nbsp;It seems like we must in case someone compiles with 64-bit.

I will recompile the 64-bit part of the Linux 0.3.8 release.
