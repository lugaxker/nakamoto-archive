Announcing version 0.3 of Bitcoin, the P2P cryptocurrency! &nbsp;Bitcoin is a digital currency using cryptography and a distributed network to replace the need for a trusted central server. &nbsp;Escape the arbitrary inflation risk of centrally managed currencies! &nbsp;Bitcoin's total circulation is limited to 21 million coins. &nbsp;The coins are gradually released to the network's nodes based on the CPU power they contribute, so you can get a share of them by contributing your idle CPU time.

What's new:<br>
\- Command line and JSON-RPC control<br>
\- Includes a daemon version without GUI<br>
\- Transaction filter tabs<br>
\- 20% faster hashing<br>
\- Hashmeter performance display<br>
\- Mac OS X version (thanks to Laszlo)<br>
\- German, Dutch and Italian translations (thanks to DataWraith, Xunie and Joozero)
