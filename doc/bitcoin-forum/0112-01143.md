A little late, but in case anyone else has the same issue. &nbsp;The compile dump had 2 warnings (that were 20 lines long) and 2 link errors. &nbsp;The errors were:

Quote

> /usr/local/include/wx-2.9/wx/buffer.h:42: undefined reference to \`wxTheAssertHandler'

> /usr/src/bitcoin/trunk/uint256.h:526: undefined reference to \`wxOnAssert(char const*, int, char const*, char const*, wchar_t const*)'

Those are probably due to switching to the release build of wxWidgets instead of debug. &nbsp;They're moving towards only debug build and ditching the release build, so they probably don't care that their release build is broken by referring to non-existent assert stuff. &nbsp;There's nothing to fear about the debug build. &nbsp;It's fully suitable for releases.

bitcoind runs as a daemon and can either be controlled by command line or JSON-RPC.

Thanks madhatter and generica for detailing the instructions for building on freebsd.
