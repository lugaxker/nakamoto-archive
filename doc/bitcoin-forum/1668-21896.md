Thank you for limiting flood tests to the testnet.

Version 0.3.15 combines several features to help legitimate transactions jump the queue during a flood attack. &nbsp;The key was Gavin's idea for prioritising transactions based on the age of their dependencies. &nbsp;Every coin is entitled to turn over so often. &nbsp;The longer waited, the more priority accumulates. &nbsp;Priority is sum(valuein * age) / txsize. &nbsp;Transaction fee still takes precedence over priority, and priority determines the order of processing within a fee strata.

In support of the priority feature, SelectCoins only uses your own 0 conf transactions only as a last resort if that's all you have left. &nbsp;This helps keep you from turning your coins over rapidly unless you're forcing it by actually turning all your coins over rapidly.
