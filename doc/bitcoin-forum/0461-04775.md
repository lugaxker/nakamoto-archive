boost::program_options has the same "key=value" format. &nbsp;Gavin pointed out we can use it in a simple way as a parser without getting into all the esoteric c++ syntax like typed value extraction. &nbsp;We can use more features if we want later.

Lets go ahead with HTTP basic authentication instead of password as a parameter.
