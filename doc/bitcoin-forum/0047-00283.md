It's much easier to have a single binary and multiple .mo files. &nbsp;It's too much maintenance work to have lots of build variations. &nbsp;Once the software support is implemented, anyone could contribute translations.

wxWidgets uses the gettext standard. &nbsp;You use the gettext tools or something like poedit to create a .po file by scanning the sourcefiles for strings and editing the translations into the .po file, then compile it into a .mo file. &nbsp;The program loads the .mo file at runtime and reskins all the strings. &nbsp;Additional languages can be added to an existing program by adding .mo files without recompiling the program.

On Windows, the .mo files would go in a lang subdirectory in the directory where the EXE is located.

Right now I'm working on JSON-RPC and command line support, but when I'm finished with that I hope to do this next.
