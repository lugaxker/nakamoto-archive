> I can only imagine the pain you went through to get these builds because I'm trying to build the program on a Ubuntu 9.04 box and so far I can't seem to find all the dependencies to compile no matter how much I keep installing packages and compiling source, LOL.

I can't understand why you're having so much pain. &nbsp;I just followed the instructions in build-unix.txt. &nbsp;I made a couple little corrections for Boost 1.37, which I'll put on SVN the next time I update it, noted below:

Dependencies<br>
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-<br>
sudo apt-get install build-essential<br>
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev<br>
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev<br>
sudo apt-get install libdb4.7-dev<br>
sudo apt-get install libdb4.7++-dev<br>
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev (or libboost1.37-dev)

wxWidgets<br>
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-<br>
cd /usr/local<br>
tar -xzvf wxWidgets-2.9.0.tar.gz<br>
cd /usr/local/wxWidgets-2.9.0<br>
mkdir buildgtk<br>
cd buildgtk<br>
../configure \-\-with-gtk \-\-enable-debug \-\-disable-shared \-\-enable-monolithic<br>
make<br>
sudo su<br>
make install<br>
ldconfig

<br>
added a comment in makefile.unix:

\# for boost 1.37, add -mt to the boost libraries<br>
LIBS= \ <br>
&nbsp;-Wl,-Bstatic \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-l boost_system \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-l boost_filesystem \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-l boost_program_options \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-l boost_thread \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-l db_cxx \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-l crypto \ <br>
&nbsp;-Wl,-Bdynamic \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-l gthread-2.0
