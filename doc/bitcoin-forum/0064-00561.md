Good suggestion. &nbsp;I made the B slightly lighter and the background slightly darker. &nbsp;Very slightly. &nbsp;The foreground is now exactly the same colour as the BC in the old one.

It's kind of OK if you can't easily read the B in the 16x16. &nbsp;At that size, you just need to see that it's a coin. &nbsp;It doesn't matter so much what's embossed on it, just that there be some detail there because it wouldn't look like a coin if it was a blank smooth circle.

It's slightly wider than tall because the dark perspective under it goes more to the right than down.

I finished and posted the 32x31 and 48x47 versions in the first message. &nbsp;I like the 48 a lot.

How does everyone feel about the B symbol with the two lines through the outside? &nbsp;Can we live with that as our logo?
