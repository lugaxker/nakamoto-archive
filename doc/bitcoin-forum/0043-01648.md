I integrated the hashmeter idea into the SVN version. &nbsp;It displays khash/s in the left section of the status bar.

Two new log messages:
21/06/2010 01:23 hashmeter &nbsp;&nbsp;2 CPUs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;799 khash/s
21/06/2010 01:23 generated 50.00

grep your debug.log for "generated" to see what you've generated, and grep for "hashmeter" to see the performance. &nbsp;On windows, use:<br />
&nbsp;findstr "hashmeter generated" "%appdata%\bitcoin\debug.log"

I have the hashmeter messages once an hour. &nbsp;How often do you think it should be?
