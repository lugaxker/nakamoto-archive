I couldn't get wxWidgets 2.8.9 to compile on Karmic 64-bit either.

I have been compiling the latest SVN on Karmic 64-bit with wxWidgets 2.9.0, which compiles fine on 64-bit. &nbsp;Read build-unix.txt and use the given ../configure parameters on wxWidgets so you can use the makefile.unix.wx2.9 as supplied. &nbsp;(\-\-enable-debug \-\-disable-shared \-\-enable-monolithic)

~~There's one cosmetic bug with 2.9.0 I still need to fix where the status number display is bunched up for some reason.~~ &nbsp;-- fixed

The download link on the homepage is to the sourceforge tar.gz archive which contains the 32-bit binary and the 0.2.0 sources, which were not yet buildable on 64-bit at the time.

The SVN was first buildable on 64-bit with wx2.9.0 on 28 January 2010.

Hopefully they'll have a wxWidgets 2.9.0 debian package someday.
