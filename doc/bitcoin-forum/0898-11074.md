If you're so paranoid that you're getting hysterical over this, then surely you're paranoid enough that if a warning message displays on the status bar, you'll check the website and forum.

I think if another bug like the overflow bug occurs, it's important that automated websites stop trading until their admins can check out what's going on and decide what to do. &nbsp;If you decide it's a false alarm and want to take your chances, you can use the "-disablesafemode" switch.
