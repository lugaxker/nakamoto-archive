> Are generated bitcoins encrypted with whichever address is currently displayed in the main Bitcoin window?

No, each generated transaction uses a new, single-use address.

Nothing uses the address in the main window, it's just there for convenience for you to copy. &nbsp;0.2.5 has a "New..." button next to it to make it easy to change each time you use it.
