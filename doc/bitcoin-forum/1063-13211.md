I don't know anything about any of the bug trackers. &nbsp;If we were to have one, we would have to make a thoroughly researched choice.

We're managing pretty well just using the forum. &nbsp;I'm more likely to see bugs posted in the forum, and I think other users are much more likely to help resolve and ask follow up questions here than if they were in a bug tracker. &nbsp;A key step is other users helping resolve the simple stuff that's not really a bug but some misunderstanding or confusion.

I keep a list of all unresolved bugs I've seen on the forum. &nbsp;In some cases, I'm still thinking about the best design for the fix. &nbsp;This isn't the kind of software where we can leave so many unresolved bugs that we need a tracker for them.
