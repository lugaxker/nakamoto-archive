Patch is uploaded to SVN rev 132!

For now, recommended steps:<br>
1) Shut down.<br>
2) Download knightmb's blk files. &nbsp;(replace your blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat files)<br>
3) Upgrade.<br>
4) It should start out with less than 74000 blocks. Let it redownload the rest.

If you don't want to use knightmb's files, you could just delete your blk*.dat files, but it's going to be a lot of load on the network if everyone is downloading the whole block index at once.

I'll build releases shortly.
