# Re: Payment server

That's the right way to do it as riX says. &nbsp;The software can generate a new bitcoin address whenever you need one for each payment. &nbsp;"Please send X bc to \[single-use bitcoin address\] to complete your order" &nbsp;When the server receives that amount to the bitcoin address, that could trigger it to automatically fulfil the order or e-mail the shop owner.

Adding command line support is a high priority. &nbsp;It's just a matter of getting the time to code it.
