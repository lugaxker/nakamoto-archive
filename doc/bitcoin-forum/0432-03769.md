# Re: BUG Report: Rounding glitch

It must be a rounding error when getinfo converts to floating point to return the JSON-RPC result. &nbsp;The only place where it uses floating point to represent money is returning a value in JSON-RPC.

1.139999999999 is longer than bitcoin can internally represent.

internally, it could only be:<br>
1.13999999 or<br>
1.14000000

1.139999999999 is much much closer to 1.14000000 than 1.13999999, so it must be 1.14000000.

The code is this:<br>
(double)GetBalance() / (double)COIN.

(I can't think of an easy way to fix it at the moment)
