There's a small transaction fee for very large transactions. &nbsp;The node that generates the block that contains the transaction gets the fee.

If the same money gets sent again, it won't incur the fee again. &nbsp;If all you have is generated coins in your wallet, if you send them all in one huge transaction, it has to bundle hundreds of 50 bc coins together. &nbsp;After that it's just one line to send the combined unit.
