This is a bugfix maintenance release. &nbsp;It is now uploaded to SourceForge. &nbsp;Mac OS X didn't need any fixes so we don't really need to update it, 0.3.0 is still good.

The download links are on bitcoin.org

Changes:<br>
\- Added Portuguese translation by Tiago Faria<br>
Windows<br>
\- Fix for 22DbRunRecoveryException if your username has non-ascii characters in it<br>

\- Laszlo's fix for lowering generate thread to lowest priority<br>
\- Fix for if you're having trouble with libcrypto linkage<br>
