Trying it without the DB\_PRIVATE flag in rev 153. &nbsp;We need to keep an eye on what's different.

On Windows at least, it creates six \_\_db.001 - \_\_db.006 files with sizes from 24K to 4MB. &nbsp;It doesn't delete them on exit, it just leaves them behind.

The docs say it uses memory mapped files. &nbsp;I assume they have the same file permissions as the database files, so the same user access restrictions apply.

Tests on Windows private LAN download of 78500 blocks:<br>
with DB\_PRIVATE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 minutes 51 seconds<br>
without DB\_PRIVATE &nbsp;&nbsp;20 minutes 51 seconds

I wasn't expecting them to come out exactly the same.
