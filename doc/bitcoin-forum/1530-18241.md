He was generating invalid blocks at difficulty 1.0. &nbsp;He must have a corrupted entry in his blk0001.dat or blkindex.dat file. &nbsp;He just needs to delete blk*.dat and let it redownload.

The safety lockdown detected the problem and was displaying "WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct!" because it saw a longer chain existed that it was unable to accept. &nbsp;The safety lockdown cannot stop generation or it would create an attack possibility.

Good idea, I made a change to make sure it won't generate before checkpoint block 74000.
