# Re: Checking the block chain on load

In the next SVN rev, I'll make it only go back to the last checkpoint at block 74000. &nbsp;If we need to correct a problem in the future, we can always make sure it goes back at least as far back as the problem. &nbsp;Also, I'm adding code to verify the block index, which means the proof-of-work chain is checked.

Still, the system won't be entirely secure against your blk\*.dat files. &nbsp;You are trusting someone if you use a copy of their blk files.
