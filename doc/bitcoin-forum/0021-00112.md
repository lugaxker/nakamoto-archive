Coins generate at the same speed with any number of connections >= 1.

More connections just add redundancy. &nbsp;If you only had one connection, what if that node is slow or busy, or only connected to you? &nbsp;Having several connections increases the certainty that you're well connected to the network. &nbsp;That hasn't been a problem in practice, the network is very thoroughly connected. &nbsp;If you have 2 or 3 connections, you're fine.
