# Re: Website and software translations

I uploaded an updated bitcoin.po for 0.3.1 attached to this message:<br>
http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=151.msg1259#msg1259

please use it if you're starting a new translation.

If you already have a po file, poedit can update it.<br>
\- Get the src directory from the 0.3.1 release candidate posted in the development forum, any version will do:<br>
http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=383.0 <br>
\- Make a subdirectory under src: locale/??/LC_MESSAGES<br>
(?? could be anything really, "en" or your language 2-letter code)<br>
\- Put your .po file there<br>
\- Open it with poedit<br>
\- In poedit, Catalog->Update from sources

The key is that the src directory with the sourcefiles needs to be 3 directories up from the .po file.
