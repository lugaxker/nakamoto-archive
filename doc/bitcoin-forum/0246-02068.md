# Re: bitcoin 0.3 win64 - broken access to APPDATA if non-latin characters in username

Thanks for finding that. &nbsp;We switched from ANSI in 0.2 to UTF-8 in version 0.3, so it must be related to that.

Just to confirm, if you log in with the non-latin character username, not having an appdata/Bitcoin directory yet, and run Bitcoin and let it create the database from scratch, does it work or not?
