But 1.0 sounds like the first release. &nbsp;For some things newness is a virtue but for this type of software, maturity and stability are important. &nbsp;I don't want to put my money in something that's 1.0. &nbsp;1.0 might be more interesting for a moment, but after that we're still 1.0 and everyone who comes along thinks we just started. &nbsp;This is the third major release and 1.3 reflects that development history. &nbsp;(0.1, 0.2, 1.3)
