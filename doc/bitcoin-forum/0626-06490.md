0.3.6 Linux build is back to the old makefile.unix. &nbsp;It static links libjpeg so that shouldn't be a problem.

Is that working better?

If you got 22DbRunRecoveryException and you've used someone else's build before, you may need to delete (or move the files somewhere else) database/log.000000\*

Windows and Linux users: if you got 0.3.5 you still need to upgrade to 0.3.6.
