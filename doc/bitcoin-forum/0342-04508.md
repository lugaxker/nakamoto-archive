Bitcoin is an implementation of Wei Dai's b-money proposal http://weidai.com/bmoney.txt on Cypherpunks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunks in 1998 and Nick Szabo's Bitgold proposal http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html

The timing is strange, just as we are getting a rapid increase in 3rd party coverage after getting slashdotted. &nbsp;I hope there's not a big hurry to wrap the discussion and decide. &nbsp;How long does Wikipedia typically leave a question like that open for comment?

It would help to condense the article and make it less promotional sounding as soon as possible. &nbsp;Just letting people know what it is, where it fits into the electronic money space, not trying to convince them that it's good. &nbsp;They probably want something that just generally identifies what it is, not tries to explain all about how it works.

If you post in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bitcoin please don't say "yeah, but bitcoin is really important and special so the rules shouldn't apply" or argue that the rule is dumb or unfair. &nbsp;That only makes it worse. &nbsp;Try to address how the rule is satisfied.

Search "bitcoin" on google and see if you can find more big references in addition to the infoworld and slashdot ones. &nbsp;There may be very recent stuff being written by reporters who heard about it from the slashdot article.

I hope it doesn't get deleted. &nbsp;If it does, it'll be hard to overcome the presumption. &nbsp;Institutional momentum is to stick with the last decision. &nbsp;(edit: or at least I assume so, that's how the world usually works, but maybe Wiki is different)
