True, sending by IP through Tor trades one problem for another. &nbsp;The Tor exit node can see the text of your message and potentially MITM you.

Best to only send to bitcoin addresses then. &nbsp;Payments by bitcoin address are broadcast over the network as part of the normal network traffic. &nbsp;All communications with the network are broadcasts of public information.
