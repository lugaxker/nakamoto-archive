Many businesses are like that. &nbsp;For a car salesman, when will the next customer walk in the door?

On the OP's question, it's a good feature, but the question is, how would we word it so people don't expect to get something after that specific amount of time? &nbsp;"it said 7 days and I waited more than a week and didn't get anything!" &nbsp;Approx, average, but still they're going to think that way. &nbsp;It can't be a whole sentence, unless we think of somewhere else to put it, but where would that be? &nbsp;Suggestions?

The difficulty quadrupled a few minutes ago to 181.54. &nbsp;It's going to take typically about a week to generate now.
