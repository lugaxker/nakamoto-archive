# Re: Idea for file hosting and proxy services

Mihalism Multi Host is a popular open source PHP file hosting server.

It's geared toward image hosting, but I think by increasing the file size limit and liberalising the allowed file extensions, it could just as easily be used for general file upload hosting. &nbsp;They need the limits to keep it reasonable as a free service, but if we bolt on a Bitcoin payment mechanism, the limits could be relaxed.

It doesn't have a bunch of client side scripting or anti-embedding junk to rip out. &nbsp;It generates standard links that work normally.

There's a turnover churn in these free hosting sites. &nbsp;Small sites can give free image hosting, but once one starts getting popular, it gets too swamped with moochers using them for free bandwidth. &nbsp;Any site that gets well known has to become more aggressively pay-naggy to cover bandwidth costs. &nbsp;It's a perfect example of a service where the needed price point is in the no-man's-land between just a little too expensive to be free, but too cheap for most users to take the trouble of a conventional payment. &nbsp;It's in the gap between 0 and 19.95. &nbsp;The best they can do is try to maybe get 1 out of 1000 users to pay 9.95, but that has 999/1000 users treated like freeloaders. &nbsp;It can't really be advertising supported because the images are embedded in other sites and downloaded without going to the hosting site.

An example of a site running the software:<br>

What do you think? &nbsp;If I made a Bitcoin payment integration for this, would anyone be interested in running it? &nbsp;It might be the first fully automated service available to buy with Bitcoins. &nbsp;The advantage it could offer over the free services is general file upload hosting of large files without making downloading users go to the upload site and jump through hoops. &nbsp;It would give a normal link directly to the file.
