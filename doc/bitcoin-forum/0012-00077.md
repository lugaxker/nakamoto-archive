That's good, is it running fine on FreeBSD?

I committed the changes to headers.h. &nbsp;For consistency, I used \_\_BSD\_\_. &nbsp;The complete list of defines is at http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_cppconst.html <br>
\#ifdef \_\_BSD\_\_<br>
\#include <netinet/in.h\><br>
\#endif

malloc.h is only needed on windows, I'll move that into the \_\_WXMSW\_\_ section before it causes any more trouble.
