The average total coins generated across the network per day stays the same. &nbsp;Faster machines just get a larger share than slower machines. &nbsp;If everyone bought faster machines, they wouldn't get more coins than before.

We should have a gentleman's agreement to postpone the GPU arms race as long as we can for the good of the network. &nbsp;It's much easer to get new users up to speed if they don't have to worry about GPU drivers and compatibility. &nbsp;It's nice how anyone with just a CPU can compete fairly equally right now.
