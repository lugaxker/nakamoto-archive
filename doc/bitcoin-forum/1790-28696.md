# Re: BitDNS and Generalizing Bitcoin

I think it would be possible for BitDNS to be a completely separate network and separate block chain, yet share CPU power with Bitcoin. &nbsp;The only overlap is to make it so miners can search for proof-of-work for both networks simultaneously.

The networks wouldn't need any coordination. &nbsp;Miners would subscribe to both networks in parallel. &nbsp;They would scan SHA such that if they get a hit, they potentially solve both at once. &nbsp;A solution may be for just one of the networks if one network has a lower difficulty.

I think an external miner could call getwork on both programs and combine the work. &nbsp;Maybe call Bitcoin, get work from it, hand it to BitDNS getwork to combine into a combined work.

Instead of fragmentation, networks share and augment each other's total CPU power. &nbsp;This would solve the problem that if there are multiple networks, they are a danger to each other if the available CPU power gangs up on one. &nbsp;Instead, all networks in the world would share combined CPU power, increasing the total strength. &nbsp;It would make it easier for small networks to get started by tapping into a ready base of miners.
