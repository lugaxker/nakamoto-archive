When and how fast did memory usage increase? &nbsp;Right away, slowly over a long time, or starting at some later event?

I have -daemon running on ubuntu 9.10 64-bit and memory usage is steady.

It has to be something about the difference on the server besides 64-bit. &nbsp;Maybe some malfunction from the lack of GUI. &nbsp;A memory leak debug tool could give a clue.
