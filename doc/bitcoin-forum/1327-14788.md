Version 0.3.13 is now available. &nbsp;You should upgrade to prevent potential problems with 0/unconfirmed transactions. &nbsp;Note: 0.3.13 prevents problems if you haven't already spent a 0/unconfirmed transaction, but if that already happened, you need 0.3.13.2.

Changes:<br>
\- Don't count or spend payments until they have 1 confirmation.<br>
\- Internal version number from 312 to 31300.<br>
\- Only accept transactions sent by IP address if -allowreceivebyip is specified.<br>
\- Dropped DB_PRIVATE Berkeley DB flag.<br>
\- Fix problem sending the last cent with sub-cent fractional change.<br>
\- Auto-detect whether to use 128-bit 4-way SSE2 on Linux.<br>
Gavin Andresen:<br>
\- Option -rpcallowip= to accept json-rpc connections from another machine.<br>
\- Clean shutdown on SIGTERM on Linux.

(Thanks Laszlo for the Mac OSX build!)

Note:<br>
The SSE2 auto-detect in the Linux 64-bit version doesn't work with AMD in 64-bit mode. &nbsp;Please try this instead and let me know if it gets it right:<br>

You can still control the SSE2 use manually with -4way and -4way=0.

Version 0.3.13.2 (SVN rev 161) has improvements for the case where you already had 0/unconfirmed transactions that you might have already spent. &nbsp;Here's a Windows build of it:<br>
