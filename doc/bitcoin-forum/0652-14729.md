# Re: BitCoin Wikipedia page DELETED!!!

If you do, I think it should be a very brief, single paragraph article like 100 words or less that simply identifies what Bitcoin is.

I wish rather than deleting the article, they put a length restriction. &nbsp;If something is not famous enough, there could at least be a stub article identifying what it is. &nbsp;I often come across annoying red links of things that Wiki ought to at least have heard of.

The article could be as simple as something like:<br>
"Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralised /link/electronic currency/link/."

The more standard Wiki thing to do is that we should have a paragraph in one of the more general categories that we are an instance of, like Electronic Currency or Electronic Cash. &nbsp;We can probably establish a paragraph there. &nbsp;Again, keep it short. &nbsp;Just identifying what it is.
