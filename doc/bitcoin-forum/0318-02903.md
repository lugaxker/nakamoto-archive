# Re: Error on Ubuntu 10.04

What language is your computer set to? &nbsp;Is it set to German, Dutch or Italian? &nbsp;Is it one of those sub-languages like "nl-??"?

It's trying to load a translation and failing. &nbsp;You could delete the locale directory that came with bitcoin so it doesn't try to use it.

Can someone test each language on Ubuntu and see if there's a problem with just one of them or maybe all three?
