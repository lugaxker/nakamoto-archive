Any backup process/procedure would just be a stopgap until there's time to properly work on coding solutions in software. &nbsp;We can try to use words to help the situation until code gets there.

The main backup improvement will be pre-made pool of keys, and a rescan at load to scrape missed transactions from the block history. &nbsp;Then a backup will last forward for a long time.
