We've been working hard on improvements for the next version release. &nbsp;Martti (sirius-m) added some nice features to make it more user friendly and easier to run in the background:<br />
&nbsp;\- Minimize to system tray option<br />
&nbsp;\- Autostart on boot option so you can keep it running in the background automatically<br />
&nbsp;\- New options dialog layout<br />
&nbsp;\- Setup EXE for Windows, in addition to the archive download

I've been working on a number of refinements to the networking code and laying the groundwork for future functionality. &nbsp;Also coming in version 0.2:<br />
&nbsp;\- Multi-processor support for coin generation<br />
&nbsp;\- Proxy support
