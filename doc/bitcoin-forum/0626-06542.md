We don't really need pre-compiled header. &nbsp;It only makes it compile slightly faster. &nbsp;I think I'll just get rid of it. &nbsp;Even still, you'd still need to remember to "make -f makefile.unix clean" or delete headers.h.gch one more time to get rid of the leftover file.

Damn that GLIBC_2.11. &nbsp;I thought I'd been careful not to accept any of the updates.
