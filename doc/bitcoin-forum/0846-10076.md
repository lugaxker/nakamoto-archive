The performance numbers posted from a VIA C7's hardware SHA-256 weren't astronomical. &nbsp;Only in the 1500 khash/s range. &nbsp;If you think about it, just because it's implemented in hardware doesn't mean it's crazy fast. &nbsp;It still has to do all the steps. &nbsp;It's only if simplifying it down to single-purpose hardware makes it small enough to fit many in parallel. &nbsp;That's not necessarily easy or a given.
