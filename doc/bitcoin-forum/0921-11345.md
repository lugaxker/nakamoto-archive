If you read it into memory and write it out, it could fail in tight memory situations.

I'm looking for something like copyfile(const char\* from, const char\* to) or copyfile(path from, path to), preferably something in Boost if it has it. &nbsp;If you find it for me, it's more likely I'll get to implementing it.

We require Boost for JSON and a dozen things replacing dependencies on wxWidgets. &nbsp;Boost is good, portable stuff, we should not shy away from it.
