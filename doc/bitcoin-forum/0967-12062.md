# Re: CryptoPP Assertion Error

You can probably just comment out the line<br>
cryptopp/secblock.h:187<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;//assert(false);

Let me know if it works, and watch if it memory leaks.

It looks like a template class to make sure the derived class defines its own version of allocate and deallocate. &nbsp;It would be weird if that was the actual problem and it made it all the way to release. &nbsp;Probably a false alarm.
