On Windows, findstr /c:"version message" debug.log

It looks like the bad chain was on block 74678 recently. &nbsp;Can't wait to overtake it.

On the stats at http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php &nbsp;there's been 5 blocks per hour in the last 3 hours. &nbsp;We had a difficulty adjustment about a day ago that should have put it back to 6 blocks per hour.
