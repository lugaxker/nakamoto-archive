Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more. &nbsp;Think of it as a donation to everyone.

> I wonder though, is there a point where the difficulty of generating a new coinbase is so high that it would make more sense to try to recover keys for lost coins or steal other people's coins instead? &nbsp;The difficulty of that is really high so for now it makes a lot more sense to generate but I just wonder what the real figures are.. would that ever become more productive? &nbsp;Maybe Satoshi can address this..

Computers have to get about 2\^200 times faster before that starts to be a problem. &nbsp;Someone with lots of compute power could make more money by generating than by trying to steal.
