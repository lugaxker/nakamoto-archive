I've been working on writing the alert system. &nbsp;Alerts are broadcast through the network and apply to a range of version numbers. &nbsp;Alert messages are signed with a private key that only I have.

Nodes can do two things in response to an alert:<br>
\- Put a warning message on the status bar.<br>
\- Make the money handling methods of the json-rpc interface return an error.

In cases like the overflow bug or a fork where users may not be able to trust received payments, the alert should keep old versions mostly safe until they upgrade. &nbsp;Manual users should notice the status bar warning when looking for received payments, and the json-rpc safe mode stops automated websites from making any more trades until they're upgraded.

The json-rpc methods that return errors during an alert are:<br>
sendtoaddress<br>
getbalance<br>
getreceivedbyaddress<br>
getreceivedbylabel<br>
listreceivedbyaddress<br>
listreceivedbylabel
