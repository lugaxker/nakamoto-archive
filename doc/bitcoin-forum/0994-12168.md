# Re: Always pay transaction fee?

Another option is to reduce the number of free transactions allowed per block before transaction fees are required. &nbsp;Nodes only take so many KB of free transactions per block before they start requiring at least 0.01 transaction fee.

The threshold should probably be lower than it currently is.

I don't think the threshold should ever be 0. &nbsp;We should always allow at least some free transactions.
