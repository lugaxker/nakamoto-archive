Sorry, I've been so busy lately I've been skimming messages and I still can't keep up.

We want to avoid Windows API calls whenever possible. &nbsp;They usually take about 6-8 parameters and a lot of testing to get right, it takes a page of code to do something simple.

I usually shy away from iostreams. &nbsp;Seems like I too often hit limitations. &nbsp;They kind of botched the C++ streams standard in the 90's, which is too bad, streams can be very powerful and useful when done right. &nbsp;Using it in rpc.cpp may still turn out to be a mistake.

Bottom line is I'd rather call an existing file copy function than make and test my own.
