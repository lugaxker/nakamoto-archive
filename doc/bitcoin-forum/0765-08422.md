That's a good point, I believe you could run with generation off if you don't have SSE2.

How about add to the top of cryptopp/config.h:

\#if !defined(\_M\_X64) && !defined(\_\_x86\_64\_\_)
\#define CRYPTOPP\_DISABLE\_SSE2 &nbsp;1
\#endif

that would disable SSE2 for 32-bit builds. &nbsp;(at least with GCC or MSVC)
