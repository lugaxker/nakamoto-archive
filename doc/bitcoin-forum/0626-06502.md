"./bitcoin: /lib64/libc.so.6: version \`GLIBC_2.11' not found (required by ./bitcoin)" isn't a new problem that started with 0.3.6 is it? &nbsp;This was built on the same OS installations as 0.3.0.

Unfortunately I upgraded to Ubuntu 10.04 before 0.3.0. &nbsp;I will not upgrade anymore. &nbsp;I don't know when I might have time to reinstall to downgrade, but at least by not upgrading, it'll gradually fix itself.
