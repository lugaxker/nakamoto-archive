It looks like we overtook the bad chain somewhere around 74689. &nbsp;0.3.9 and lower nodes have been responding with the current block number for some hours now.

That means it's no longer necessary to delete blk\*.dat before upgrading. &nbsp;You can just upgrade and it'll reorg away the bad block chain.

Thanks to everyone for the quick response!
