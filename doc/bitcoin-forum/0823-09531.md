It would help if people stop generating. &nbsp;We will probably need to re-do a branch around the current one, and the less you generate the faster that will be.

A first patch will be in SVN rev 132. &nbsp;It's not uploaded yet. &nbsp;I'm pushing some other misc changes out of the way first, then I'll upload the patch for this.
