I have the beginning of something like this. &nbsp;It's mostly like what Gavin described.

Some more rpc interface:

move <fromaccount\> <toaccount\> <amount\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move from one internal account to another. &nbsp;I think blank account name ("") will be your default account. &nbsp;If you sell something to a user, you could do move "theiraccount" "" 123.45.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is "move" the best name for this? &nbsp;I shied away from "transfer" because that sounds too close to sending a transaction.

I'm thinking a new function getaccountaddress instead of overloading getnewaddress:

getaccountaddress <account\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives you an address allocated from getnewaddress <account\>. &nbsp;It'll keep giving the same address until something is received on the address, then it allocates a new address. &nbsp;(It automatically does what the sample code I posted some time ago did)

Would these commands make it possible in simple cases to implement your website without needing a database of your own?
