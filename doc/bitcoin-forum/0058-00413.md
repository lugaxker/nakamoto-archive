# Re: Number of connections

Nodes stop trying to initiate connections once they have 15. &nbsp;If you can accept incoming connections, then you can get well above that from nodes connecting to you, otherwise you max out at 15.

I don't know if there's any reason to have 15 connections. &nbsp;Maybe it should be 10.

Since nodes that can only connect out are probably at or near 15 most of the time now, you should level off to an equilibrium. &nbsp;45 suggests a ratio of 3 out-only nodes to every 1 in-accepting node.

The number of connections won't be a good gauge of the size of the network any more. &nbsp;Someone should periodically IRC to the bitcoin channel on chat.freenode.net and count the number of users. &nbsp;That gives you the total count of network nodes (except TOR nodes).

Block generation is again running ahead of pace. &nbsp;We're in for another big step up in difficulty at the next adjustment in about 5 days.
