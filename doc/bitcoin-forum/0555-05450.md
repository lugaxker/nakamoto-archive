# Re: Reading/Writing Blocks and FLATDATA

FLATDATA was a workaround to serialize a fixed field length array. &nbsp;There was a cleaner way to make it understand how to serialize arrays directly, but MSVC6 couldn't do it and I wanted to keep compatibility with MSVC6 at that time. &nbsp;We don't support MSVC6 anymore because we use something in Boost that doesn't. &nbsp;We lost support for it after 0.2.0. &nbsp;Maybe someday I'll swap in the clean way that just knows how to serialize fixed length arrays without wrapping them in FLATDATA.
