> Adding transactions to the block you're working on will slow down your generation rate

The premise is false. &nbsp;Adding more transactions to the block you're working on does NOT slow down your generation rate. &nbsp;When generate is scanning hashes, it only hashes the header of the block, which is constant size. &nbsp;The header contains a hash of the transactions (the Merkle root) and is only updated occasionally.

If necessary I can write code to make nodes prefer not to use a block if it doesn't contain enough of the transactions they know about. &nbsp;A discouraged block would almost always fail to be included in the main chain, but would be accepted if it did get in. &nbsp;I doubt this will be necessary, since there's no real advantage for nodes not to include all transactions.
