2 seconds of latency in both directions should reduce your generation success by less than 1%.

Probably OK, but I'm not sure. &nbsp;The protocol is designed to resync to the next message, and messages get re-requested from all the other nodes you're connected to until received. &nbsp;If you miss a block, it'll also keep requesting it every time another blocks comes in and it sees there's a gap. &nbsp;Before the original release I did a test dropping 1 out of 4 random messages under heavy load until I could run it overnight without any nodes getting stuck.
