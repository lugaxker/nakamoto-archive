Download links available now on bitcoin.org. &nbsp;Everyone should upgrade to this version.

\- Added a simple security safeguard that locks-in the block chain up to this point.<br>
\- Reduced addr messages to save bandwidth now that there are plenty of nodes to connect to.<br>
\- Spanish translation by milkiway.<br>
\- French translation by aidos.

The security safeguard makes it so even if someone does have more than 50% of the network's CPU power, they can't try to go back and redo the block chain before yesterday. &nbsp;(if you have this update)

I'll probably put a checkpoint in each version from now on. &nbsp;Once the software has settled what the widely accepted block chain is, there's no point in leaving open the unwanted non-zero possibility of revision months later.
