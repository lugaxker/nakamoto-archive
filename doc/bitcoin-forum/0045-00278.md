No, sorry. &nbsp;I've been meaning to redo it. &nbsp;The largest icon that still looks good is the 20x20 one which is used for the tray icon in GNOME. &nbsp;Any larger than that looks bad. &nbsp;The 16x16 and 20x20 ones have quite a bit of hand tweaking to get the pixels to work out right. &nbsp;If you just scale down a larger image, the pixels end up blurred and awkward in places where the lines in "BC" don't land square on a pixel.

The best 16x16 with full alpha channel is in src/rc/bitcoin.ico. &nbsp;I don't like the 32x32 version.

I'm attaching bitcoin20x20.png, the 20x20 version with full transparency.
