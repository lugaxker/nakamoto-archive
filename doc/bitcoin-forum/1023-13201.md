Bouncing between 0 and 2 connections could be if it's connecting to itself. &nbsp;Are you using the "-connect" switch?

Did you compile it or is this a release build, and what version?

I'm not sure how the 200Kb/sec, since it waits at least a half second between connection attempts. &nbsp;How fast is it flickering between 0 and 2 connections? &nbsp;Faster than twice a second?

The wait function on linux is:

inline void Sleep(int64 n)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boost::thread::sleep(boost::get_system_time() + boost::posix_time::milliseconds(n));
}

If that doesn't work right, then it would be possible for it to spin through the loop as fast as it can.
