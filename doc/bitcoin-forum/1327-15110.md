# Re: Version 0.3.13, please upgrade

Post by: satoshi on October 03, 2010, 07:39:06 PM

Could a few people please run this special build? &nbsp;It'll amnesty the dust spam transactions, which will clear up the 0/unconfirmed problem for now. &nbsp;We really just need one block letting them through to clear up the previous transactions. &nbsp;Post if you generate a block with this.

These are binaries only. &nbsp;The linux version is 64-bit only.<br>

The linux 64-bit version includes a change to the cpuid 4-way 128-bit SSE2 autodetect for AMD in 64-bit mode, if you'd like to test that and see if that's better.
