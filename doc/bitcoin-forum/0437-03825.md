> However, it's important that you don't lock all the way up the very latest block. &nbsp;Otherwise, the attacker could generate a fake block (or a few) right before you happen to lock it, and then his attack would be far easier than it would have been without the block lock.

I went about 200 blocks back. &nbsp;The block chain was a clean straight line without branches, and there was only one known version of the locked block.

Sorry, not yet, but I do want to make the initial block download faster.
