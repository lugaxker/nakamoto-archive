# Version 0.3.8.1 update for Linux 64-bit

Post by: satoshi on August 09, 2010, 07:46:58 PM

When we switched to Crypto++ 5.6.0 SHA-256 in version 0.3.6, generation got broken on the Linux 64-bit build. &nbsp;Version 0.3.8.1 is on SourceForge with the 64-bit binary updated.

Future versions after 0.3.8 will probably require SSE2. &nbsp;Anyone have Pentium 3 or older where this would be a problem?
