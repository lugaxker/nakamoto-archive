> Perhaps there should be a feature against this? For instance, if a transaction isn't accepted by the recipient for a long period of time (a month?), the transaction will be canceled and the coins returned to the one who sent them?

That's not possible. &nbsp;You've handed control of the money over to the recipient's keypair. &nbsp;Only that key can control it.

It's similar to if you encrypt a file with AES and a strong password, and you lose the password. &nbsp;The data is lost.
