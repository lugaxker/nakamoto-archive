I don't know how to do SVG, but I did the original very large, over 500 pixels across, so it can be scaled down. &nbsp;I'll give the original when I'm finished.

I had to custom tweak each icon size so the vertical lines land square on their pixels, otherwise they're ugly blurry and inconsistent. &nbsp;Such is the challenge of making icons. &nbsp;The original will be good for scaling to custom sizes between 48 and 500 but not smaller.
