# Re: JSON-RPC Multiple Invocations

Obviously it's a bug that it repeats the header.

I was trying to follow the 1.0 spec: http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification &nbsp;&nbsp;It called for multiple invocation.

I think they mean it's like this, but I'm not sure:

Post:<br>
{"method": "postMessage", "params": ["Hello all!"\], "id": 99}<br>
{"method": "postMessage", "params": ["I have a question:"\], "id": 101}

Reply:<br>
{"result": 1, "error": null, "id": 99}<br>
{"result": 1, "error": null, "id": 101}

I can't remember where I think I saw that it's supposed to send back HTTP status 500 for an error reply. &nbsp;If it contains multiple responses and one is an error, I wonder if that makes the status 500 for the whole thing, I guess so. &nbsp;Maybe it should always return 200. &nbsp;I think someone sounded like the 500 might be causing a problem.

This probably gets fixed after 0.3.3. &nbsp;Until then, just use single invocation. &nbsp;I wonder if any JSON-RPC package even supports multiple invocation, probably not.

It would be nice if we could pin down better how multiple-invocation is supposed to work, if at all, before trying to fix it, and whether returning HTTP status 500 for error response is right.
