@dtvan: all 3 excellent points.<br />
1) IP records don't need to be in the chain, just do registrar function not DNS. &nbsp;And CA problem solved, neat.<br />
2) Pick one TLD, .web +1.<br />
3) Expiration and significant renewal costs, very important.

Avoiding CPU power fragmentation is no longer a reason. &nbsp;Independent networks/chains can share CPU power without sharing much else. &nbsp;See: http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696 and http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1790.msg28715#msg28715
