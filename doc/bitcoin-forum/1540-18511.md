The only thing I can think of is to see if there are other versions of mingwm10.dll you can get. &nbsp;mingwm10.dll is a tiny little DLL that came with the MinGW compiler that you need when you build for multi-thread. &nbsp;I don't know exactly what it does, but it probably just says something like "yes Windows, see I'm in a DLL like you insisted."

The end of your debug.log file might show the last thing it was doing before it crashed.
