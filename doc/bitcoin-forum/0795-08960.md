No, that's not what it is.

-paytxfee allows you to include a transaction fee with your transactions. &nbsp;If transaction confirmations become slow, you can get priority by using "-paytxfee=0.01". &nbsp;Any transactions you send would cost an extra 0.01. &nbsp;There's no reason to use more than 0.01.

It's just there in case we need it. &nbsp;It probably won't be needed, and it can be explained more if we do.
