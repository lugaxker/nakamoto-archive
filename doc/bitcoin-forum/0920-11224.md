# Re: RFC: remove DB_PRIVATE flag

Can you provide more details about what removing DB\_PRIVATE does?

I can't remember if I had a specific reason for DB\_PRIVATE, or if I just copied the flags from some example code. &nbsp;Does removing DB\_PRIVATE make it safe for other processes to open the database simultaneously? &nbsp;That may be an improvement, depending what the side effects are. &nbsp;Does it substantially reduce performance by making it have to write out every change immediately or do other coordination? &nbsp;Are there additional locking or coordination files then? &nbsp;What else changes? &nbsp;You could test by timing an initial block download with and without DB\_PRIVATE, preferably -connect-ing to a local machine so network isn't a factor.

Apparently, DB\_PRIVATE doesn't do what you would hope it would do, which is prevent other processes from being able to open the database. &nbsp;It still lets them, it just screws up if they do. &nbsp;Another option, if there's a way, would be to make it lock the database files so they can't be accessed by other processes.
