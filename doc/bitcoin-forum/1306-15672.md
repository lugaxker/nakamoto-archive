That's going to be more of a SelectCoins thing.

SVN rev 161 has a refinement to recursively determine if your own unconfirmed transactions can be spent. &nbsp;This is needed because you should be able to spend your own change right away.

The new recursive determination is: 0/unconfirmed can be spent if it's yours and all its dependencies are either in a block or also yours.

Here's a Windows build:<br>
http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.13.2-win32-setup.exe

This version is an improvement if you already had a 0/unconfirmed transaction and might have already spent it. &nbsp;If you were the original creator of a 0/unconfirmed transaction, you still need theymos' patch instead.
