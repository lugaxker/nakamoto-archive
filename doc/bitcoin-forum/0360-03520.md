# Re: Hash() function not secure

SHA256 is not like the step from 128 bit to 160 bit.

To use an analogy, it's more like the step from 32-bit to 64-bit address space. &nbsp;We quickly ran out of address space with 16-bit computers, we ran out of address space with 32-bit computers at 4GB, that doesn't mean we're going to run out again with 64-bit anytime soon.

SHA256 is not going to be broken by Moore's law computational improvements in our lifetimes. &nbsp;If it's going to get broken, it'll be by some breakthrough cracking method. &nbsp;An attack that could so thoroughly vanquish SHA256 to bring it within computationally tractable range has a good chance of clobbering SHA512 too.

If we see a weakness in SHA256 coming gradually, we can transition to a new hash function after a certain block number. &nbsp;Everyone would have to upgrade their software by that block number. &nbsp;The new software would keep a new hash of all the old blocks to make sure they're not replaced with another block with the same old hash.
