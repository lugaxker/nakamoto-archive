# Re: Feature Request: Limiting Connections

Thanks for the feedback on this.

One thing we could do is lower the outbound connections from 15 to 10 or maybe even 5. &nbsp;The choice of 15 was arbitrary. &nbsp;It just needs to be enough for redundancy and fast exponential propagation of messages. &nbsp;10 would still be plenty. &nbsp;5 should be fine. &nbsp;10 is good as a nice round number so users can see that it stopped intentionally.

It would help to implement UPnP so there would be more inbound accepting nodes. &nbsp;Your number of connections is the ratio of inbound accepting nodes to out-only times 15. &nbsp;We need to encourage more people to accept inbound connections.

I will implement a feature to stop accepting inbound connections once you hit a certain number.

Which version are you running?

Anyone know how many connections typical P2P software like BitTorrent can get up to?
