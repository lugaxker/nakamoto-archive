Right. &nbsp;Otherwise we couldn't have a finite limit of 21 million coins, because there would always need to be some minimum reward for generating. &nbsp;In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes. &nbsp;I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.
