Right, that is quite a bit better.

Can you give me any examples of other stuff that does it that way? &nbsp;(and what the command line looks like)

The main change you're talking about here is instead of -rpcpw= when you start bitcoind, you'd use a switch that specifies a text file to go and read it from, right? &nbsp;(any ideas what I should name the switch?)
