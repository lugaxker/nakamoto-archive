It's in init.cpp.

It's a wxWidgets app, so it doesn't have a main() function. &nbsp;It may in a little while, since I'm pretty close to making bitcoind build w/o wxBase. &nbsp;(it'll be in init.cpp)

Sorry about my choice of the filename "main.cpp", another possible name would have been "core.cpp". &nbsp;It's much too late to change. &nbsp;I still prefer main.cpp.

We're still in great need of sample code showing the recommended way to use the JSON-RPC functions, like for a basic account system on a typical storefront website. &nbsp;Using getreceivedbylabel using the username as the label, changing to a new bitcoin address once the stored one for that account gets used. &nbsp;I posted a sample code fragment on the forum somewhere. &nbsp;(search on getreceivedbylabel or getnewaddress) &nbsp;The sample code could be a plain vanilla bank site where you can deposit and send payments.
