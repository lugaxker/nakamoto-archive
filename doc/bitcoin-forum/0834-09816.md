# Re: checkpointing the block chain

There is no way for the software to automatically know if one chain is better than another except by the greatest proof-of-work. &nbsp;In the design it was necessary for it to switch to a longer chain no matter how far back it has to go.

The only exception to that is the manual checkpoints I've added. &nbsp;If it weren't for those, it would be able to reorg all the way back to the first block.
