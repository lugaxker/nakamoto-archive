# Checking the block chain on load

Post by: satoshi on August 16, 2010, 08:07:46 PM

SVN rev 139 does a basic check of the block chain after loading.

With this we wouldn't have needed to delete blk\*.dat, it would have automatically done a reorg back to the fork. &nbsp;There wasn't time to do a careful implementation of this at the time.

It might take longer than we want, since it has to load all the blocks. &nbsp;If it's too slow, we could have it only go back to a certain block number.
