# Re: Could the bitcoin network be destroyed by someone generating endless bitcoin add

When you generate a new bitcoin address, it only takes disk space on your own computer (like 500 bytes). &nbsp;It's like generating a new PGP private key, but less CPU intensive because it's ECC. &nbsp;The address space is effectively unlimited. &nbsp;It doesn't hurt anyone, so generate all you want.
