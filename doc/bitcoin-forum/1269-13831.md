# Internal version number

Post by: satoshi on September 23, 2010, 04:19:08 PM

In the next release (0.3.13), I'm going to change the format of the internal version number integer from 313 to 31300, for instance 31305 = 0.3.13.5. &nbsp;The last number represents changes on the SVN between releases and ought to be properly represented in the version number. &nbsp;Otherwise, it would be a pain if we had a mistake or something in one of the sub versions that needed to be worked around.
