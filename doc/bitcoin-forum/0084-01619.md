# Re: On IRC bootstrapping

The SVN version now uses IRC first and if that fails it falls back to a hardcoded list of seed nodes. &nbsp;There are enough seed nodes now that many of them should still be up by the time of the next release. &nbsp;It only briefly connects to a seed node to get the address list and then disconnects, so your connections drop back to zero for while. &nbsp;At that point, be patient. &nbsp;It's only slow to get connected the first time.

This means TOR users won't need to -addnode anymore, it'll get connected automatically.
