Laszlo corrected this, but unfortunately it was too late to make it into 0.3.0. &nbsp;There will probably be a 0.3.1 soon though.

The problem is I used PRIO_MIN, I should have used PRIO_MAX for the lowest priority. &nbsp;The OS isn't supposed to let you increase priority, so the PRIO_MIN ought to leave it at priority 0.
