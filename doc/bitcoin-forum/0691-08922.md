True, there would probably be someone with a dial-up modem or satellite dish internet. &nbsp;Rarer would be someone who has both that and the wired internet that has the outage, but if it's a big enough segment to matter, out of a million people there's bound to be a multi-home geek.

ISP network cuts are just your local area. &nbsp;If you still have communication with the rest of your area, it would probably be something like 1/1000 of the world or less. &nbsp;Block generation in the segment would take several hours per block.

I favour the plan to monitor if the frequency of blocks received drops too slow. &nbsp;That covers a large range of possibilities.
