# Re: Scalability and transaction rate

The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. &nbsp;That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. &nbsp;The design supports letting users just be users. &nbsp;The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. &nbsp;Those few nodes will be big server farms. &nbsp;The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less. &nbsp;If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.<br>
