Subject: Citation of your b-money page

I was very interested to read your b-money page. &nbsp;I'm getting ready to release a paper that expands on your ideas into a complete working system. &nbsp;Adam Back (hashcash.org) noticed the similarities and pointed me to your site.

I need to find out the year of publication of your b-money page for the citation in my paper. &nbsp;It'll look like:<br>
[1] W. Dai, "b-money," http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt, (2006?).

You can download a pre-release draft at<br>

Title: Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party

Abstract: A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the burdens of going through a financial institution. &nbsp;Digital signatures offer part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent double-spending. &nbsp;We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. &nbsp;The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. &nbsp;The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. &nbsp;As long as honest nodes control the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any attackers. &nbsp;The network itself requires minimal structure. &nbsp;Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
